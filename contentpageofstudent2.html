        <p>The planet Earth is 4,560 million years old. For over 3,000 million years, life on land was confined to the oceans, and the land areas of the planet looked much like the rocky landscapes of Mars today. Complex life on land, and the terrestrial ecosystems,is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of the Earth. There are three major events during Earth's history as the sculpting of earth, earth cooling and primitive life and the age of reptiles and dinosaurs.</p>

                        Sculpting the earth internationally acclaimed artist Strijdom van der Merwe over fore consecutive seasons as he travels to remote locations in the southern African interior to make beautiful land art works in a striking range of spectacular natural settings.

                    <p>
                        Featuring 25 fleeting artworks, the film shows the artist at work in the landscape and sharing his thoughts as he finds his canvases in nature - in verdant valleys and forests, on the shore of a lagoon, in the vast expanses of the arid semi-desert. With stunning cinematography and an extraordinary soundtrack including 11 pieces of music composed for the film, Sculpting this earth is meditative, powerful and moving.

                        The collision of the moon into Earth significantly imapacted climate, oceans and life on earth. Because the moon's orbit drags earth, it slowed Earth's rotation significantly from 6-hours days to 24 hours. Having the moon in orbit also stabilized the earth from wobbing. But most importanly, the collision of the moon tilted earth on its axis. And because the Earth is tiled on its Axix, Earth now had seasons.

And the earth cooled down enough to create continents. Though opinions vary, "Vaalbara" because earth's first supercontinent.

                        The Age of reptiles is a 110-feet (34 m) mural depicting the period of ancient history when reptiles were the dominant creatures on the earth, painted by Rudolph Zallinger. The fresco sits in the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut, and was completed in 1947 after five years of work. The age of reptiles was at one time the largest painting in the world, and depicts a span of nearly 350 million years in Earth's history.
