          Protecting life on land is helpful for maintaining balance of our
          planet.Natural ecosystems, which include forests, grasslands,
          wetlands, and deserts, provide critical services that sustain life.
          These ecosystems act as natural water filters, help regulate climate,
          and offer habitat and food for countless species, including humans. By
          conserving and restoring these areas, we ensure that we can continue
          to benefit from the resources and services they provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the dominant species on Earth, humans have a essential duty to
          protect the environment for future generations.This means taking
          sustainable actions for prevent environment pollution and reducing
          human impact on natural habitats.

        <br />
        <p>
          We need to take care of our forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands
          by conserving, restoring, and using them in ways that are good for the
          environment.

        <h2>INCLUDE ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY IN GOVERNMENT PLANS</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Governments should think about how important ecosystems and
